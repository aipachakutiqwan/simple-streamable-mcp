# simple-streamable-mcp

Welcome to the lightweight Streamable MCP client-server chatbot powered by Anthropic Claude as the LLM backend.

## âš¡ Introduction

This repository provides a simple implementation of a streamable MCP client-server chatbot that uses Anthropic Claude as the LLM backend. The chatbot is designed to answer questions about research papers on arXiv or extract specific information from them.

You should review the logic, refactor the code to fit your requirements, and write appropriate unit tests before considering it for any production deployment.
